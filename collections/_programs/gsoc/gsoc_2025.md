  As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud native infrastructure.

  As a mentee, you will learn cloud native infrastructure management techniques, and will increase your understanding of distributed systems challenges and how to properly implement best-practice patterns of modern software design.

  To best position your candidacy, start participating in the project so that you can self-assess your readiness and interest. We work hard to guarantee your success. That starts with your own internal reflection of whether the project and community are a fit for you.

  Engage in an area in which you think you can make an impact. And if you are being impactful and consistent, eventually we will bring the internship to you. Moreover you will take away exactly the same real value that an internship offers: experience and relationships.
